ALGOL68G - ALGOL 68 GENIE (MARK 9.X)
------------------------------------

Algol68G is a nearly fully featured implementation of Algol 68 as defined by 
the Revised Report.

Algol68G's front-end parses an entire Algol 68 source program. If parsing is 
successful, the syntax tree (that serves as an intermediate program 
representation) is interpreted by Algol68G's back-end. The interpreter performs
many runtime checks. 

Author of Algol68G is Marcel van der Veer <algol68g@xs4all.nl>.
