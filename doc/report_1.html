<a name=1></a>1. Language and metalanguage
</h3>

<h3>
<a name=11></a>1.1. The method of description
</h3>

<h3>
<a name=111></a>1.1.1. Introduction
</h3>

<p>
<a name=111a></a>a) ALGOL 68 is a language in which algorithms may be formulated for computers, i.e., for automata or for human beings. It is defined by this Report in four stages, the "syntax"  {b}, the "semantics" {c}, the "representations" {d} and the "standard environment" {e}.

<p>
<a name=111b></a>b) The syntax is a mechanism whereby all the constructs of the language may be produced. This mechanism proceeds as follows:

<ol type=i>
<li>A set of "hyper-rules" and a set of "metaproduction rules" are given {<a href="#1134">1.1.3.4</a>, <a href="#1133">1.1.3.3</a>}, from which "production rules" may be derived:
<li>A "construct in the strict language" is a "production tree" {<a href="#1132f">1.1.3.2.f</a>} which may be produced by the application of a subset of those production rules; this production tree contains static information {i.e., information known at "compile time"} concerning that construct: it is composed of a hierarchy of descendent production trees, terminating at the lowest level in the "<b>symbols</b>"; with each production tree is associated a "nest" of properties, declared in the levels above, which is passed on to the nests of its descendents;
<li>A "<b>program</b> in the strict language" is a production tree for the notion <b>'program'</b> {<a href="report_1.html#221a">2.2.1.a</a>}. It must also satisfy the "environment condition" {<a href="report_5.html#A12">10.1.2</a>}.
</ol>

<p>
<a name=111c></a>c) The semantics ascribes a "meaning" {<a href="report_1.html#2141a">2.1.4.1.a</a>} to each construct {i.e., to each production tree} by defining the effect (which may, however, be "undefined") of its "elaboration" {<a href="report_1.html#2141">2.1.4.1</a>}. This proceeds as follows:

<ol type=i>
<li>A dynamic {i.e., run-time} tree of active "actions" is set up {<a href="report_1.html#214">2.1.4</a>}; typically, an action is the elaboration of some production tree <i>T</i> in an "environ" consistent with the nest of <i>T</i>, and it may bring about the elaboration of descendents of <i>T</i> in suitable newly created descendent environs;
<li>The meaning of a <b>program</b> in the strict language is the effect of its elaboration in the empty "primal environ".
</ol>

<p>
<a name=111d></a>d) A <b>program</b> in the strict language must be represented in some "representation language" {<a href="report_4.html#93a">9.3.a</a>}  chosen by the implementer. In most cases this will be the official "reference language".

<ol type=i>
<li>A <b>program</b> in a representation language is obtained by replacing the <b>symbols</b> of a <b>program</b> in the strict language by certain typographical marks {<a href="report_4.html#93">9.3</a>}.
<li>Even the reference language allows considerable discretion to the implementer {<a href="report_4.html#94a">9.4.a, b,    c</a>}. A restricted form of the reference language in which such freedom has not been exercised may be termed the "canonical form" of the language, and it is expected that this form will be used in algorithms intended for publication.
<li>The meaning of a <b>program</b> in a representation language is the same as that of the <b>program</b> {in the strict language} from which it was obtained.
</ol>

<p>
<a name=111e></a>e) An algorithm is expressed by means of a <b>particular-program</b>, which is considered to be embedded, together with the standard environment, in a <b>program-text</b> {<a href="report_5.html#A11a">10.1.1.a</a>}. The meaning of a <b>particular-program</b> {in the strict or a representation language} is the meaning of the <b>program</b> "akin" to that <b>program-text</b> {<a href="report_5.html#A12a">10.1.2.a</a>}.

<h3>
<a name=113></a>1.1.3. The syntax of the strict language
</h3>

<h3>
<a name=1131></a>1.1.3.1. Protonotions
</h3>

<p>
<a name=1131a></a>a) In the definition of the syntax of the strict language, a formal grammar is used in which certain syntactic marks appear. These may be classified as follows:

<OL type=i>
<li>"small syntactic marks", written, in this Report, as<br>
"<b>a</b>", "<b>b</b>", "<b>c</b>", "<b>d</b>", "<b>e</b>", "<b>f</b>", "<b>g</b>", "<b>h</b>", "<b>i</b>", "<b>j</b>", "<b>k</b>", "<b>l</b>", "<b>m</b>", "<b>n</b>", "<b>o</b>", "<b>p</b>", "<b>q</b>", "<b>r</b>", "<b>s</b>", "<b>t</b>", "<b>u</b>", "<b>v</b>", "<b>w</b>", "<b>x</b>", "<b>y</b>", "<b>z</b>", "<b> (</b>", "<b>)</b>";
<li>"large syntactic marks", written, in this Report, as<br>
"<b>A</b>", "<b>B</b>", "<b>C</b>", "<b>D</b>", "<b>E</b>", "<b>F</b>", "<b>G</b>", "<b>H</b>", "<b>I</b>", "<b>J</b>", "<b>K</b>", "<b>L</b>", "<b>M</b>", "<b>N</b>", "<b>O</b>", "<b>P</b>", "<b>Q</b>", "<b>R</b>", "<b>S</b>", "<b>T</b>", "<b>U</b>", "<b>V</b>", "<b>W</b>", "<b>X</b>", "<b>Y</b>", "<b>Z</b>", "<b>0</b>", "<b>1</b>", "<b>2</b>", "<b>3</b>", "<b>4</b>", "<b>5</b>", "<b>6</b>", "<b>7</b>", "<b>8</b>", "<b>9</b>";
<li>"other syntactic marks", written, in this Report, as<br>
"<b>.</b>" ("point"), "<b>,</b>" ("comma"), "<b>:</b>" ("colon"), "<b>;</b>" ("semicolon"), ""    ("apostrophe"), "<b>-</b>" ("hyphen") and "<b>*</b>" ("asterisk").  </li></ol> {Note that these marks are in another type font than that of the marks in this sentence.}

<p>
<a name=1131b></a>b) A "protonotion" is a possibly empty sequence of small syntactic marks.

<p>
<a name=1131c></a>c) A "notion" is a {nonempty} protonotion for which a production rule can be derived {<a href="#1132a">1.1.3.2.a</a>, <a href="#1134d">1.1.3.4.d</a>}.

<p>
<a name=1131d></a>d) A "metanotion" is a {nonempty} sequence of large syntactic marks for which a metaproduction rule is given or created {<a href="#1133a">1.1.3.3.a</a>}.

<p>
<a name=1131e></a>e) A "hypernotion" is a possibly empty sequence each of whose elements either is a small syntactic mark or is a metanotion.

<p>
{Thus the class of protonotions {b} is a subclass of the class of hypernotions. Hypernotions are used in metaproduction rules {<a href="#1133">1.1.3.3</a>}, in hyper-rules {<a href="#1134">1.1.3.4</a>}, as paranotions {<a href="#1142">1.1.4.2</a>}  and, in their own right, to "designate" certain classes of protonotions {<a href="#1141">1.1.4.1</a>}.}

<p>
{A "paranotion" is a hypernotion to which certain special conventions and interpretations apply, as detailed in <a href="#1142">1.1.4.2</a>  .}

<p>
<a name=1131f></a>f) A "symbol" is a protonotion ending with <b>'symbol'</b>.  {Note that the paranotion <b>symbol</b> {<a href="report_4.html#911h">9.1.1.h</a>} designates a particular occurrence of such a protonotion.}

<p>
{Examples:<br>
b) <b>'variable point'</b><br>
c) <b>'variable point numeral'</b> {<a href="report_4.html#8121b">8.1.2.1.b</a>}<br>
d) "<b>INTREAL</b>" {<a href="#121C">1.2.1.C</a>}<br>
e) <b>'reference to INTREAL'</b><br>
f) <b>'letter a symbol'</b>. }

<p>
Note that the protonotion <b>'twas brillig and the slithy toves'</b> is neither a symbol nor a notion, in that it does not end with <b>'symbol'</b> and no production rule can be derived for it. Likewise, "<b>LEWIS</b>" and  "<b>CAROLL</b>" are not metanotions in that no metaproduction rules are given for them.

<p>
<a name=1131g></a>g) In order to distinguish the various usages in the text of this Report of the terms defined above, the following conventions are adopted:

<OL type=i>
<li>No distinguishing marks {quotes, apostrophes or hyphens} are used in production rules, metaproduction rules or hyper-rules;
<li>Metanotions, and hypernotions which stand for themselves {i.e., which do not designate protonotions}, are enclosed in quotes;
<li>Paranotions are not enclosed in anything {but, as an aid to the reader,    are provided with hyphens where, otherwise, they would have been provided with blanks};
<li>All other hypernotions {including protonotions} not covered above are enclosed in apostrophes {in order to indicate that they designate some protonotion, as defined in <a href="#1141a">1.1.4.1.a</a>};
<li>Typographical display features, such as blank space, hyphen, and change to a new line or new page, are of no significance (but see also <a href="report_4.html#94d">9.4.d</a>    ).
</li>
</ol>

<p>
{Examples:
  (i) <b>LEAP :: local ; heap ; primal.</b> is a metaproduction rule ;
 (ii) "<b>INTREAL</b>" is a metanotion and designates nothing but itself;
 (iii) <b>reference-to-INTREAL-identifier</b>, which is not enclosed in apostrophes but is provided with hyphens, is a paranotion designating a construct {<a href="#1142a">1.1.4.2.a</a>};
 (iv) <b>'variable point'</b> is both a hypernotion and a protonotion; regarded as a hypernotion, it designates itself regarded as a protonotion;    
  (v) <b>'reference to real'</b> means the same as <b>'referencetoreal'</b>. }

<h3>
<a name=1132></a>1.1.3.2. Production rules and production trees
</h3>

<p>
<a name=1132a></a>a) The {derived} "production rules" {b} of the language are those production rules which can be derived from the "hyper-rules" {<a href="#1134">1.1.3.4</a>}, together with those specified informally in <a href="report_4.html#8141d">8.1.4.1.d</a>  and <a href="report_4.html#921d">9.2.1.d</a>.

<p>
<a name=1132b></a>b) A "production rule" consists of the following items, in order:
<dl>

<dd>
an optional asterisk ; a nonempty protonotion <i>N</i> ; a colon ; a nonempty sequence of "alternatives" separated by semicolons ; a point.
</dd>

</dl>
It is said to be a production rule "for" {the notion {<a href="#1131c">1.1.3.1.c</a>}} <i>N</i>.

<p>
{The optional asterisk, if present, signifies that the notion is not used in other production rules, but is provided to facilitate discussion in the semantics. It also signifies that that notion may be used as an "abstraction"  {<a href="#1142b">1.1.4.2.b</a>} of one of its alternatives.}

<p>
<a name=1132c></a>c) An "alternative" is a nonempty sequence of "members"  separated by commas.

<p>
<a name=1132d></a>d) A "member" is either

<OL type=i>
<li>a notion {and may then be said to be productive, or nonterminal},
<li>a symbol {which is terminal},
<li>empty, or <li>some other protonotion {for which no production rule can be derived},    which is then said to be a "blind alley".
</ol>
{For example, the member <b>'reference to real denotation'</b> (derived from the hyper-rule <a href="report_4.html#801a">8.0.1.a</a>  ) is a blind alley.}

<p>
{Examples:
b) <b>exponent part : times ten to the power choice, power of ten.</b> {<a href="report_4.html#8121g">8.1.2.1.g</a>}&bull;  <b>times ten to the power choice : times ten to the power symbol ; letter e symbol.</b> {<a href="report_4.html#8121h">8.1.2.1.h</a>}
c) <b>times ten to the power choice, power of ten &bull; times ten to the power symbol &bull; letter e symbol</b>
d) <b>times ten to the power choice &bull; power of ten &bull; times ten to the power symbol &bull; letter e symbol</b> }

<p>
<a name=1132e></a>e) A "construct in the strict language" is any "production tree" {f} that may be "produced" from a production rule of the language.

<p>
<a name=1132f></a>f) A "production tree" <i>T</i> for a notion <i>N</i>, which is termed the "original" of <i>T</i>, is "produced" as follows:  <ul>   <li>let <i>P</i> be some {derived} production rule for <i>N</i>;    <li>a copy is taken of <i>N</i>;    <li>a sequence of production trees, the "direct descendents" of <i>T</i>, one produced for each nonempty member of some alternative <i>A</i> of <i>P</i>, is attached to the copy; the order of the sequence is the order of those members within <i>A</i>;    <li>the copy of the original, together with the attached direct descendents,    comprise the production tree <i>T</i>. </li></ul>A "production tree" for a symbol consists of a copy of that symbol {i.e., it consists of a <b>symbol</b>}.

<p>
The "terminal production" of a production tree <i>T</i> is a sequence consisting of the terminal productions of the direct descendents of <i>T</i>, taken in order.

<p>
The "terminal production" of a production tree consisting only of a <b>symbol</b> is that <b>symbol</b>.

 'letter e symbol'   'plus symbol'      'digit zero symbol' 'digit two symbol'
</b>
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
{The terminal production of this tree is the sequence of <b>symbols</b> at the bottom of the tree. In the reference language, its representation would be <tt>e+02</tt>.}

<p>
A "terminal production" of a notion is the terminal production of some production tree for that notion {thus there are many other terminal productions of <b>'exponent part'</b> besides the one shown}.

<p>
{The syntax of the strict language has been chosen in such a way that a given sequence of <b>symbols</b> which is a terminal production of some notion is so by virtue of a unique production tree, or by a set of production trees which differ only in such a way that the result of their elaboration is the same (e.g., production trees derived from rules <a href="report_2.html#321e">3.2.1.e</a>  (balancing), <a href="#131d">1.3.1.d,e</a>  (predicates) and <a href="report_3.html#671a">6.7.1.a,b</a>  (choice of spelling of the mode of a <b>coercend</b> to be voided); see also <a href="report_1.html#222a">2.2.2.a</a>  ).

<p>
Therefore, in practice, terminal productions (or representations thereof) are used, in this Report and elsewhere, in place of production trees. Nevertheless, it is really the production trees in terms of which the elaboration of programs is defined by the semantics of this Report, which is concerned with explaining the meaning of those constructs whose originals are the notion <b>'program'</b>.}

<p>
<a name=1132g></a>g) A production tree <i>P</i> is a "descendent" of a production tree <i>Q</i> if it is a direct descendent {f} either of <i>Q</i> or of a descendent of <i>Q</i>. <i>Q</i> is said to "contain" its descendents and those descendents are said to be "smaller" than <i>Q</i>. {For example, the production tree

<p>
<ul>
<pre>
<b>
 'plusminus option'
  |
 'plusminus'
  |
 'plus symbol'
</b>
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
occurs as a descendent in (and is contained within and is smaller than) the production tree for <b>'exponent part'</b> given above.}

<p>
<a name=1132h></a>h) A "visible" ("invisible") production tree is one whose terminal production is not (is) empty.

<p>
<a name=1132i></a>i) A descendent {g} <i>U</i> of a production tree <i>T</i>  is "before" ("after") a descendent <i>V</i> of <i>T</i> if the terminal production {f} of <i>U</i> is before (after) that of <i>V</i> in the terminal production of <i>T</i>. The {partial} ordering of the descendents of <i>T</i>  thus defined is termed the "textual order". {In the example production tree for <b>'exponent part'</b> {f}, the production tree whose original is <b>'plusminus'</b> is before that whose original is <b>'digit two'</b>.}

<p>
<a name=1132j></a>j) A descendent <i>A</i> of a production tree "follows"  ("precedes") another descendent <i>B</i> in some textual order if <i>A</i> is after (before) <i>B</i> in that textual order, and there exists no visible {h}  descendent <i>C</i> which comes between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. {Thus  "immediately" following (preceding) is implied.}

<p>
<a name=1132k></a>k) A production tree <i>A</i> is "akin" to a production tree <i>B</i> if the terminal production {f} of <i>A</i> is identical to the terminal production of <i>B</i>.

<h3>
<a name=1133></a>1.1.3.3. Metaproduction rules and simple substitution
</h3>

<p>
{The metaproduction rules of the language form a set of context-free grammars defining a "metalanguage".}

<p>
<a name=1133a></a>a) The "metaproduction rules" {b} of the language are those given in the sections of this Report whose heading begins with "Syntax", "  Metasyntax" or "Metaproduction rules", together with those obtained as follows:  <ul>   <li>for each given metaproduction rule, whose metanotion is <i>M</i> say,    additional rules are created each of which consists of a copy of <i>M</i>    followed by one of the large syntactic marks "<b>0</b>", "<b>1</b>", "<b>2</b>", "<b>3</b>", "<b>4</b>", "<b>5</b>", "<b>6</b>", "<b>7</b>", "<b>8</b>" or "<b>9</b>", followed by two colons, another copy of that <i>M</i> and a point. </li></ul> {Thus, the metaproduction rule "<b>MODE1 ::  MODE.</b>" is to be added.}

<p>
<a name=1133b></a>b) A "metaproduction rule" consists of the following items, in order:

<ul>
an optional asterisk;<br>
a nonempty sequence <i>M</i> of large syntactic marks;<br>

a nonempty sequence of hypernotions {<a href="#1131e">1.1.3.1.e</a>} separated by semicolons;<br>

It is said to be a metaproduction rule "for" {the metanotion {<a href="#1131d">1.1.3.1.d</a>}} <i>M</i>.

<p>
{The asterisk, if present, signifies that the metanotion is not used in other metaproduction rules or in hyper-rules, but is provided to facilitate discussion in the semantics.}

<p>
{Examples:
<p>
<b>INTREAL :: SIZETY integral ; SIZETY real.</b> (<a href="#121C">1.2.1.C</a>)&bull;<br>
<b>SIZETY :: long LONGSETY ; short SHORTSETY ; EMPTY.</b> (<a href="#121D">1.2.1.D</a>) }

<p>
<a name=1133c></a>c) A "terminal metaproduction" of a metanotion <i>M</i> is any protonotion which is a "simple substitute" {d} for one of the hypernotions {on the right hand side} of the metaproduction rule for <i>M</i>.

<p>
<a name=1133d></a>d) A protonotion <i>P</i> is a "simple substitute" for a hypernotion <i>H</i> if a copy of <i>H</i> can be transformed into a copy of <i>P</i> by replacing 
each metanotion <i>M</i> in the copy by some terminal metaproduction of <i>M</i>.

<p>
{Thus two possible terminal metaproductions {c} of "<b>INTREAL</b>" are <b>'integral'</b> and <b>'long long real'</b>. This is because the hypernotions <b>'SIZETY integral'</b> and <b>'SIZETY real'</b> (the hypernotions of the metaproduction rule for "<b>INTREAL</b>") may, upon simple substitution {d}, give rise to <b>'integral'</b> and <b>'long long real'</b>, which, in turn, is because <b>''</b> (the empty protonotion) and <b>'long long'</b> are terminal metaproductions of "<b>SIZETY</b>".}

<p>
{The metanotions used in this Report have been so chosen that no concatenation of one or more of them gives the same sequence of large syntactic marks as any other such concatenation. Thus a source of possible ambiguity has been avoided.

<p>
Although the recursive nature of some of the metaproduction rules makes it possible to produce terminal metaproductions of arbitrary length, the length of the terminal metaproductions necessarily involved in the production of any given <b>program</b> is finite.}

<h3>
<a name=1134></a>1.1.3.4. Hyper-rules and consistent substitution
</h3>

<p>
<a name=1134a></a>a) The hyper-rules {b} of the language are those given in the sections of this Report whose heading begins with "Syntax".

<p>
<a name=1134b></a>b) A "hyper-rule" consists of the following items, in order:
<ul>
an optional asterisk ;<br>
a nonempty hypernotion <i>H</i> ;<br>
a colon ;<br>
a nonempty sequence of "hyperalternatives" separated by semicolons ;<br>
a point.
</ul>
It is said to be a hyper-rule "for" {the hypernotion {<a href="#1131e">1.1.3.1.e</a>}} <i>H</i>.

<p>
<a name=1134c></a>c) A "hyperalternative" is a nonempty sequence of hypernotions separated by commas.

<p>
{Examples:<br>
b) <b>NOTION sequence : NOTION ; NOTION, NOTION sequence.</b> {<a href="#133b">1.3.3.b</a>}<br>
c) <b>NOTION, NOTION sequence</b> }

<p>
<a name=1134d></a>d) A production rule <i>PR</i> {<a href="#1132b">1.1.3.2.b</a>} is derived from a hyper-rule <i>HR</i> if a copy of <i>HR</i> can be transformed into a copy of <i>PR</i> by replacing the set of all the hypernotions in the copy by a "consistent substitute" {e} for that set.

<p>
<a name=1134e></a>e) A set of {one or more} protonotions <i>PP</i> is a  "consistent substitute" for a corresponding set of hypernotions <i>HH</i> if a copy of <i>HH</i> can be transformed into a copy of <i>PP</i> by means of the following step:

<p>
<a name=113s4></a>

<DL compact>
<dt>
Step :
<ul>
If the copy contains one or more metanotions then, for some terminal metaproduction <i>T</i> of one such metanotion <i>M</i>, each occurrence of <i>M</i> in the copy is replaced by a copy of <i>T</i> and the Step is taken again.
</ul>
{See <a href="#1141a">1.1.4.1.a</a>  for another application of consistent substitution.}

<p>
{Applying this derivation process to the hyper-rule given above {c} may give rise to
<ul>
<b>digit cypher sequence : digit cypher ; digit cypher, digit cypher sequence.</b>
</ul>
which is therefore a production rule of the language. Note that
<ul>
<b>digit cypher sequence : digit cypher ; digit cypher, letter b sequence.</b>
</ul>
is not a production rule of the language, since the replacement of the metanotion "<b>NOTION</b>" by one of its terminal metaproductions must be consistent throughout.}

<p>
{Since some metanotions have an infinite number of terminal metaproductions, the number of production rules which may be derived is infinite. The language is, however, so designed that, for the production of any <b>program</b> of finite length, only a finite number of those production rules is needed.}

<p>
<a name=1134f></a> {f) The rules under Syntax are provided with  "cross-references" to be interpreted as follows.

<p>
Each hypernotion <i>H</i> of a hyperalternative of a hyper-rule <i>A</i> is followed by a reference to those hyper-rules <i>B</i> whose derived production rules are for notions which could be substituted for that <i>H</i>. Likewise, the hypernotions of each hyper-rule <i>B</i> are followed by a reference back to <i>A</i>. Alternatively, if <i>H</i> is to be replaced by a symbol, then it is followed by a reference to its representation in section <a href="report_4.html#941">9.4.1</a> . Moreover, in some cases, it is more convenient to give a <b>cross-reference</b>  to one metaproduction rule rather than to many hyper-rules, and in these cases the missing cross-references will be found in the metaproduction rule.

<p>
Such a reference is, in principle, the section number followed by a letter indicating the line where the rule or representation appears, with the following conventions:

<ol type=i>
<li>the references whose section number is that of the section in which they appear are given first and their section number is omitted; e.g., "8.2.1.a"    appears as "a" in section "<a href="report_4.html#821">8.2.1</a>    ";
<li>all points and a final 1 are omitted, and 10 appears as A; e.g., "8.2.1.a"    appears as "82a" elsewhere and "10.3.4.1.1.i" appears as "A341i";
<li>a section number which is the same as that of the preceding reference is omitted; e.g., "82a,82b,82c" appears as "82a,b,c";
<li>the presence of a blind alley derived from that hypernotion is indicated by "-"; e.g., in <a href="report_4.html#801a">8.0.1.a</a>    after "<b>MOID denotation</b>", since "<b>MOID</b>" may be replaced by, for example, <b>'reference to real'</b>, but <b>'reference to real denotation'</b>    is not a notion.}
</ol>

<h3>
<a name=114></a>1.1.4. The semantics
</h3>

<p>
The "meaning" of <b>programs</b> {<a href="report_1.html#221a">2.2.1.a</a>} in the strict language is defined in the semantics by means of sentences {in somewhat formalized natural language} which specify the "actions" to be carried out during the "elaboration" {<a href="report_1.html#2141">2.1.4.1</a>} of those <b>programs</b>. The "meaning" of a <b>program</b> in a representation language is the same as the meaning of the <b>program</b> in the strict language which it represents {<a href="report_4.html#93">9.3</a>}.

<p>
{The semantics makes extensive use of hypernotions and paranotions in order to "designate", respectively, protonotions and constructs. The word "designate"  should be understood in the sense that the word "flamingo" may "designate" any animal of the family <i>Phoenicopteridae</i>.}

<h3>
<a name=1141></a>1.1.4.1. Hypernotions, designation and envelopment
</h3>

<p>
{Hypernotions, when enclosed between apostrophes, are used to  "designate" protonotions belonging to certain classes; e.g., <b>'LEAP'</b>  designates any of the protonotions <b>'local'</b>, <b>'primal'</b> and <b>'heap'</b>.}

<p>
<a name=1141a></a>a) Hypernotions standing in the text of this Report, except those in hyper-rules {<a href="#1134b">1.1.3.4.b</a>} or metaproduction rules {<a href="#1133b">1.1.3.3.b</a>},  "designate" any protonotions which may be consistently substituted {<a href="#1134e">1.1.3.4.e</a>} for them, the consistent substitution being applied over all the hypernotions contained in each complete sub-section of the text (a sub-section being one of the lettered sub-divisions, if any, or else the whole, of a numbered section).

<p>
{Thus <b>'QUALITY TAX'</b> is a hypernotion designating protonotions such as <b>'integral letter i'</b>, <b>'real letter x'</b>, etc. If, in some particular discussion, it in fact designates <b>'integral letter i'</b>, then all occurrences of "<b>QUALITY</b>" in that subsection must, over the span of that discussion, designate <b>'integral'</b> and all occurrences of "<b>TAX</b>" must designate <b>'letter i'</b>. It may then be deduced from subsection <a href="report_2.html#482a">4.8.2.a</a>  that in order, for example, to "ascribe to an <b>integral-defining-indicator-with-letter-i</b>", it is <b>'integral letter i'</b> that must be "made to access <i>V</i> inside the locale".}

<p>
Occasionally, where the context clearly so demands, consistent substitution may be applied over less than a section. {For example, in the introduction to section <a href="report_1.html#2112">2.1.1.2</a>, there are several occurrences of "<b>'MOID'</b>", of which two are stated to designate specific (and different) protonotions spelled out in full, and of which others occur in the plural form "<b>'MOID'</b>s", which is clearly intended to designate a set of different members of the class of terminal metaproductions of "<b>MOID</b>".}

<p>
<a name=1141b></a>b) If a protonotion (a hypernotion) <i>P</i> consists of the concatenation of the protonotions (hypernotions) <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, where <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> are possibly empty, then <i>P</i>  "contains" <i>B</i> at the position {in <i>P</i>} determined by the length of <i>A</i>. {Thus, <b>'abcdefcdgh'</b> contains <b>'cd'</b> at its third and seventh positions.}

<p>
<a name=1141c></a>c) A protonotion <i>P1</i> "envelops" a protonotion <i>P2</i> as specifically designated by a hypernotion <i>H2</i> if <i>P2</i>, or some equivalent {<a href="report_1.html#2112a">2.1.1.2.a</a>} of it, is contained {b} at some position within <i>P1</i> but not, at that position, within any different {intermediate} protonotion <i>P3</i> also contained in <i>P1</i> such that <i>H2</i> could also designate <i>P3</i>.
<br>
{Thus the <b>'MODE'</b> enveloped by <b>'reference to real closed clause'</b>  is <b>'reference to real'</b> rather than <b>'real'</b>; moreover, the mode {<a href="report_1.html#2112b">2.1.1.2.b</a>} specified by <tt>STRUCT (REAL a, STRUCT (BOOL b, CHAR c) d)</tt> envelops <b>'FIELD'</b> just twice.}

<h3>
<a name=1142></a>1.1.4.2. Paranotions
</h3>

<p>
{In order to facilitate discussion, in this Report, of constructs with specified originals, the concept of a  "paranotion" is introduced. A paranotion is a noun that designates constructs {<a href="#1132e">1.1.3.2.e</a>}; its meaning is not necessarily that found in a dictionary but can be construed from the rules which follow.}

<p>
<a name=1142a></a>a) A "paranotion" <i>P</i> is a hypernotion {not between apostrophes} which is used, in the text of this Report, to "designate" any construct whose original <i>O</i> satisfies the following:
<ul>
<li><i>P</i>, regarded as a hypernotion {i.e., as if it had been enclosed in apostrophes}, designates {<a href="#1141a">1.1.4.1.a</a>} an "abstraction" {b} of <i>O</i>.
</ul>
{For example, the paranotion  "<b>fixed-point-numeral</b>" could designate the construct represented by <tt>02</tt>, since, had it been in apostrophes, it would have designated an abstraction of the notion <b>'fixed point numeral'</b>, which is the original of that construct. However, that same representation could also be described as a <b>digit-cypher-sequence</b>, and as such it would be a direct descendent of that <b>fixed-point-numeral</b>.}

<p>
{As an aid to the reader in distinguishing them from other hypernotions, paranotions are not enclosed between apostrophes and are provided with hyphens where, otherwise, they would have been provided with blanks.}

<p>
The meaning of a paranotion to which the small syntactic mark "<b>s</b>" has been appended is the same as if the letter "s" {which is in the same type font as the marks in this sentence} had been appended instead. {Thus the <b>fixed-point-numeral</b> <tt>02</tt> may be said to contain two <b>digit-cyphers</b>, rather than two <b>digit-cypher</b>s.} Moreover, the  "<b>s</b>" may be inserted elsewhere than at the end if no ambiguity arises {e.g., "<b>sources-for-MODINE</b>" means the same as  "<b>source-for-MODINEs</b>"}.

<p>
An initial small syntactic mark of a paranotion is often replaced by the corresponding large syntactic mark (in order to improve readability, as at the start of a sentence) without change of meaning {; e.g., "<b>Identifier</b>"  means the same as "<b>identifier</b>"}.

<p>
<a name=1142b></a>b) A protonotion <i>P2</i> is an "abstraction" of a protonotion <i>P1</i> if

<OL type=i>
<li><i>P2</i> is an abstraction of a notion whose production rule begins with an asterisk and of which <i>P1</i> is an alternative
<ul>
{e.g., <b>'trimscript'</b> {<a href="report_2.html#5321h">5.3.2.1.h</a>} is an abstraction of any of the notions designated by <b>'NEST trimmer'</b>,    <b>'NEST subscript'</b> and <b>'NEST revised lower bound option'</b>}, or
</ul>
<li><i>P1</i> envelops a protonotion <i>P3</i> which is designated by one of the "elidible hypernotions" listed in section c below, and <i>P2</i> is an abstraction of the protonotion consisting of <i>P1</i> without that enveloped <i>P3</i>
<br>
{e.g., <b>'choice using boolean start'</b> is an abstraction of the notions <b>'choice using boolean brief start'</b> and <b>'choice using boolean bold start'</b> (by elision of a <b>'STYLE'</b> from <a href="report_4.html#911a">9.1.1.a</a>    )}, or
</p>
<li><i>P2</i> is equivalent to {<a href="report_1.html#2112a">2.1.1.2.a</a>}<i>P1</i>
</ol>
{e.g., <b>'bold begin symbol'</b> is an abstraction of <b>'bold begin symbol'</b>} .

<p>
{For an example invoking all three rules, it may be observed that <b>'union of real integral mode defining indicator'</b> is an abstraction of some <b>'union of integral real mode NEST defining identifier with letter a'</b> {<a href="report_2.html#481a">4.8.1.a</a>}. Note, however, that <b>'choice using union or integral real mode brief start'</b> is not an abstraction of the notion <b>'choice using union of integral real boolean mode brief start'</b>, because the <b>'boolean'</b> that has apparently been elided is not an enveloped <b>'MOID'</b> of that notion.}

<p>
<a name=1142c></a>c) The "elidible hypernotions" mentioned in section b above are the following:

<p>
"<b>STYLE</b>" &bull; "<b>TALLY</b>" &bull; "<b>LEAP</b>" &bull; "<b>DEFIED</b>"  &bull; "<b>VICTAL</b>" &bull; "<b>SORT</b>" &bull; "<b>MOID</b>" &bull; "<b>NEST</b>" &bull; "<b>REFETY routine</b>" &bull; "<b>label</b>" &bull; "<b>with TAX</b>" &bull; "<b>with DECSETY LABSETY</b>"  &bull; "<b>of DECSETY LABSETY</b>" &bull; "<b>defining LAYER</b>".

<p>
{Which one of several possible notions or symbols is the original of a construct designated by a given paranotion will be apparent from the context in which that paranotion appears. For example, when speaking of the <b>formal-declarer</b> of an <b>identity-declaration</b>, if the <b>identity-declaration</b> is one whose terminal production {<a href="#1132f">1.1.3.2.f</a>} happens to be <tt>REF REAL x = LOC REAL</tt>, then the original of that <b>formal-declarer</b> is some notion designated by <b>'formal reference to real NEST declarer'</b>.}

<p>
{Since a paranotion designates a construct, all technical terms which are defined for constructs can be used with paranotions without formality.}

<p>
<a name=1142d></a>d) If two paranotions <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i> designate, respectively, two constructs <i>S</i> and <i>T</i>, and if <i>S</i> is a descendent of <i>T</i>, then <i>P</i> is termed a "constituent" of <i>Q</i>  unless there exists some {intermediate construct} <i>U</i> such that

<OL type=i>
<li><i>S</i> is a descendent of <i>U</i>,
<li><i>U</i> is a descendent of <i>T</i>, and
<li>either <i>P</i> or <i>Q</i> could {equally well} designate <i>U</i>.
</ol>
{Hence <tt>a</tt> (<i>S1</i>) is a constituent <b>operand</b> of the <b>formula</b> <tt>a * (b + 2 &uarr; (i + j))</tt> (<i>T</i>), but <tt>b</tt>  (<i>S2</i>) is not, since it is a descendent of an intermediate <b>formula</b>  <tt>b + 2 &uarr; (i + j)</tt> (<i>U</i>), which is itself descended from <i>T</i>. Likewise, <tt> (b + 2 &uarr; (i + j ))</tt> is a constituent <b>closed-clause</b> of the <b>formula</b> <i>T</i>, but the <b>closed-clause</b> <tt> (i + j)</tt> is not, because it is descended from an intermediate <b>closed-clause</b>. However,  <tt> (i + j)</tt> is a constituent <b>integral-closed-clause</b> of <i>T</i>, because the intermediate <b>closed-clause</b> is, in fact, a <b>real-closed-clause</b>.

<h3>
<a name=132></a>1.3.2. The holding of predicates
</h3>

<p>
A "predicate" is a protonotion which begins with <b>'where'</b> or <b>'unless'</b> {unified into <b>'WHETHER'</b>} . For a predicate <i>P</i>, either one or more production trees may be produced {<a href="#1132f">1.1.3.2.f</a>} {all of which are then invisible}, in which case <i>P</i> "holds", or no production tree may be produced {since each attempt to produce one runs into blind alleys}, and then <i>P</i> "does not hold".

<p>
{For example, the predicate <b>'where (ab) is (ab)'</b> holds. Its production tree may be depicted thus:
<pre>
<b>
'where (ab) is (ab)'
 |
'where (ab) begins with (ab) and (ab) begins with (ab)'
 |
 -------------------------------
 |                             |
'where (ab) begins with (ab)' 'where (ab) begins with (ab)'
 |                            (same as left branch)
 |
'where (a) coincides with (a) in (abc ...z) and (b) begins with (b)'
 |
 --------------------------------------------
 |                                           |
'where (a) coincides with (a) in (abc ...z)' |
 |                                           |
'where true'                                'where (b) begins with (b)'
                                             |
 ---------------------------------------------
 |                                           |
'where (b) coincides with (b) in (abc ...z)' |
 |                                           |
'where true'                                'where () begins with ()'
                                             |
                                            'where true'
</b>
</pre>

<p>
If a predicate holds, then its production tree always terminates via <b>'where true'</b> or <b>'unless false'</b>. If it does not hold, then, in general, the blind alleys are <b>'where false'</b> and <b>'unless true'</b>. Although almost all the hyper-rules concerned are for hypernotions beginning with "<b>WHETHER</b>" and so provide, each time, production rules for pairs of predicates such as <b>'where THING1'</b> and <b>'unless THING1'</b>, this does not mean that in each such case one of the pair must hold. For example,  <b>'where digit four counts iii'</b> {<a href="report_2.html#431c">4.3.1.c</a>} does not hold, but no care has been taken to make <b>'unless digit four counts iii'</b> hold either, since there is no application for it in this Report.

<p>
In the semantics, no meaning is ascribed to constructs whose originals are predicates. They serve purely syntactical purposes.}

The computer deals with a set of "objects" {<a href="report_1.html#211">2.1.1</a>}.

<DIV align=right> {"When <i>I</i> use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a<br>
scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean <br>
- neither more nor less."<br>
Through the Looking-glass, Lewis Carroll.}
</div>

<h3>
<a name=211></a>2.1.1. Objects
</h3>

<p>
An "object" is a construct {<a href="report_1.html#1132e">1.1.3.2.e</a>}, a "value" {<a href="report_1.html#2111a">2.1.1.1.a</a>}, a "locale" {<a href="report_1.html#2111b">2.1.1.1.b</a>}, an "environ" {<a href="report_1.html#2111c">2.1.1.1.c</a>} or a "scene" {<a href="report_1.html#2111d">2.1.1.1.d</a>}.

<p>
{Constructs may be classified as "external objects", since they correspond to the text of the <b>program</b>, which, in a more realistic computer, would be compiled into some internal form in which it could operate upon the "internal objects", namely the values, the locales, the environs and the scenes. However, the hypothetical computer has no need of a compilation phase, it being presumed able to examine the <b>program</b> and all of its descendent constructs at the same time as it is manipulating the internal objects.}

<h3>
<a name=2111></a>2.1.1.1. Values, locales, environs and scenes
</h3>

<p>
<a name=2111a></a>a) A "value" is a "plain value" {<a href="report_1.html#2131">2.1.3.1</a>}, a "name" {<a href="report_1.html#2132">2.1.3.2</a>}, a "stowed value" (i.e., a "structured value" {<a href="report_1.html#2133">2.1.3.3</a>} or a "multiple value" {<a href="report_1.html#2134">2.1.3.4</a>}  ) or a "routine" {<a href="report_1.html#2135">2.1.3.5</a>}.

<p>
{For example, a real number is a plain value. A special font is used for values appearing in the text of this Report, thus: 3.14, <tt>true</tt>. This is not to be confused with the italic and bold fonts used for constructs. This same special font is also used for letters designating such things as constructs and protonotions.}

<p>
<a name=2111b></a>b) A "locale" {is an internal object which} corresponds to some <b>'DECSETY LABSETY'</b> {<a href="report_1.html#123C">1.2.3.C,I</a>}. A "vacant locale" is one for which that <b>'DECSETY LABSETY'</b> is <b>'EMPTY'</b>.

<p>
{Each <b>'QUALITY TAX'</b> {<a href="report_2.html#481F">4.8.1.F, G</a>} enveloped by that <b>'DECSETY LABSETY'</b> corresponds to a <b>QUALITY-defining-indicator-with-TAX</b> {i.e., to an <b>identifier</b>,  <b>operator</b> or <b>mode-indication</b>} declared in the construct whose elaboration caused that locale to be created. Such a <b>'QUALITY TAX'</b> may be made to "access" a value or a scene "inside" that locale {<a href="report_1.html#212c">2.1.2.c</a>}

<p>
A locale may be thought of as a number of storage cells, into which such accessed objects are placed.}

<p>
{The terminal metaproductions of the metanotions "<b>DEC</b>", "<b>LAB</b>"  and "<b>FIELD</b>" (or of the more frequently used "<b>PROP</b>", which includes them all) are all of the form <b>'QUALITY TAX'</b>. These "properties" are used in the syntax and semantics concerned with nests and locales in order to associate, in a particular situation, some quality with that <b>'TAX'</b>.}

<p>
<a name=2111c></a>c) An "environ" is either empty, or is composed of an environ and a locale.

<p>
{Hence, each environ is derived from a series of other environs, stemming ultimately from the empty "primal environ" in which the <b>program</b> is elaborated {<a href="report_1.html#222a">2.2.2.a</a>}.}

<p>
<a name=2111d></a>d) A "scene" <i>S</i> is an object which is composed of a construct <i>C</i> {<a href="report_1.html#1132e">1.1.3.2.e</a>} and an environ <i>E</i>. <i>C</i> is said to be the construct, and <i>E</i>  the environ, "of" <i>S</i>.

<p>
{Scenes may be accessed inside locales {<a href="report_1.html#212c">2.1.2.c</a>} by <b>'LAB'</b>s or <b>'DEC'</b>s arising from <b>label-identifiers</b> or from <b>mode-indications</b>, and they may also be values {<a href="report_1.html#2135">2.1.3.5</a>}.}

<h3>


<p>
<a name=2112></a>2.1.1.2. Modes
</h3>

<p>
{Each value has an attribute, termed its  "mode", which defines how that value relates to other values and which actions may be applied to it. This attribute is described, or "spelled", by means of some <b>'MOID'</b> {<a href="report_1.html#121R">1.2.1.R</a>} (thus there is a mode spelled <b>'real'</b>, and there is a mode spelled <b>'structured with real field letter r letter e real field letter i letter m mode'</b>). Since it is intended that the modes specified by the <b>mode-indications</b> <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> in

<pre>
MODE A = STRUCT (REF A b),
MODE B = STRUCT (REF STRUCT (REF B b) b)
</pre>
should in fact be the same mode, it is necessary that both the <b>'MOID'</b>
<br>
TAB<b>'mui definition of structured with reference to mui application field letter b mode'</b><br>
and the <b>'MOID'</b>
<br>
TAB<b>'muii definition of structured with reference to structured with reference to muii application field letter b mode field letter b mode'</b><br>
(and indeed many others) should be alternative spellings of that same mode. Similarly, the mode specified by the <b>declarer</b> <tt>UNION (INT, REAL)</tt> may be spelled as either <b>'union of integral real mode'</b> or <b>'union of real integral mode'</b>. All those <b>'MOID'</b>s which are spellings of one same mode are said to be "equivalent to" one another {a}.

<p>
Certain <b>'MOID'</b>s, such as <b>'reference to muiii application'</b>,  <b>'reference to muiiii definition of reference to muiiii application'</b>,  <b>'union of real reference to real mode'</b>, and <b>'structured with integral field letter a real field letter a mode'</b>, are ill formed {<a href="report_3.html#74">7.4</a>, <a href="report_2.html#471f">4.7.1.f</a>, <a href="report_2.html#481c">4.8.1.c</a>}  and do not spell any mode.

<p>
Although for most practical purposes a "mode" can be regarded as simply a <b>'MOID'</b>, its rigorous definition therefore involves the whole class of <b>'MOID'</b>s, equivalent to each other, any of which could describe it.}

<p>
<a name=2112a></a>a) <b>'MOID1'</b> {<a href="report_1.html#121R">1.2.1.R</a>} is "equivalent to" <b>'MOID2'</b> if the predicate <b>'where MOID1 equivalent MOID2'</b> {<a href="report_3.html#731a">7.3.1.a</a>} holds {<a href="report_1.html#132">1.3.2</a>}.

<p>
{A well formed <b>'MOID'</b> is always equivalent to itself: <b>'union of integral real mode'</b> is equivalent to <b>'union of real integral mode'</b>.}

<p>
A protonotion <i>P</i> is "equivalent to" a protonotion <i>Q</i> if it is possible to transform a copy <i>Pc</i> of <i>P</i> into at copy <i>Qc</i> of <i>Q</i> in the following step:

<br>
<a name=211s2></a>
<ul>
Step : If <i>Pc</i> is not identical to <i>Qc</i>, then some <b>'MOID1'</b> contained in <i>Pc</i>, but not within any {larger} <b>'MOID2'</b> contained in <i>Pc</i>, is replaced by some equivalent <b>'MOID'</b>, and the Step is taken again.
</ul>
{Thus <b>'union of integral real mode identifier'</b> is equivalent to <b>'union of real integral mode identifier'</b>.}

<p>
<a name=2112b></a>b) A "mode" is a class <i>C</i> of <b>'MOID'</b>s such that each member of <i>C</i> is equivalent {a} to each other member of <i>C</i> and also to itself {in order to ensure well formedness}, but not to any <b>'MOID1'</b> which is not a member of <i>C</i>.

<p>
{However, it is possible (except when equivalence of modes is specifically under discussion) to discuss a mode as if it were simply a terminal metaproduction of "<b>MOID</b>", by virtue of the abbreviation to be given in <a href="report_1.html#215f">2.1.5.f</a>  .}

<p>
<a name=2112c></a>c) Each value is of one specific mode.

<p>
{For example, the mode of the value 3.14 is <b>'real'</b>. However, there are no values whose mode begins with <b>'union of'</b>, <b>'transient reference to'</b> or <b>'flexible ROWS of'</b> (see <a href="report_1.html#2136">2.1.3.6</a>  ).}

<h3>
<a name=2113></a>2.1.1.3. Scopes
</h3>

<p>
{A value <i>V</i> may "refer to" {<a href="report_1.html#212e">2.1.2.e</a>}, or be composed from {<a href="report_1.html#2111d">2.1.1.1.d</a>} another internal object <i>O</i> (e.g., a name may refer to a value; a routine, which is a scene, is composed, in part, from an environ). Now the lifetime of the storage cells containing {<a href="report_1.html#2132a">2.1.3.2.a</a>} or implied by {<a href="report_1.html#2111b">2.1.1.1.b</a>}  <i>O</i> may be limited (in order that they may be recovered after a certain time), and therefore it must not be possible to preserve <i>V</i> beyond that lifetime, for otherwise an attempt to reach some no-longer-existent storage cell via <i>V</i> might still be made. This restriction is expressed by saying that, if <i>V</i> is to be "assigned" {<a href="report_2.html#5212b">5.2.1.2.b</a>} to some name <i>W</i>, then the "scope" of <i>W</i> must not be "older" than the scope of <i>V</i>. Thus, the scope of <i>V</i> is a measure of the age of those storage cells, and hence of their lifetime.}

<p>
<a name=2113a></a>a) Each value has one specific "scope" {which depends upon its mode or upon the manner of its creation; the scope of a value is defined to be the same as that of some environ}.

<p>
<a name=2113b></a>b) Each environ has one specific "scope". {The scope of each environ is "newer" {<a href="report_1.html#212f">2.1.2.f</a>} than that of the environ from which it is composed {<a href="report_1.html#2111c">2.1.1.1.c</a>}.}

{The scope of an environ is not to be confused with the scopes of the values accessed inside its locale. Rather, the scope of an environ is used when defining the scope of scenes for which it is necessary {<a href="report_3.html#722c">7.2.2.c</a>} or of the yields of generators for which it is "local" {<a href="report_2.html#5232b">5.2.3.2.b</a>}. The scope of an environ is defined relative {<a href="report_1.html#212f">2.1.2.f</a>} to the scope of some other environ, so that hierarchies of scopes are created depending ultimately upon the scope of the primal environ {<a href="report_1.html#222a">2.2.2.a</a>}.}

<p>
<a name=212></a>2.1.2. Relationships
</h3>
<a name=212a></a>a) Relationships either are "permanent", i.e., independent of the <b>program</b> and of its elaboration, or actions may cause them to "hold" or to cease to hold. Relationships may also be "transitive"; i.e., if "*" is such a relationship and A*B and B*C hold, then A*C holds also.

<p>
<a name=212b></a>b) "To be the yield of" is a relationship between a value and an action, viz., the elaboration of a scene. This relationship is made to hold upon the completion of that elaboration {<a href="report_1.html#2141b">2.1.4.1.b</a>}.

<p>
<a name=212c></a>c) "To access" is a relationship between a <b>'PROP'</b> {<a href="report_2.html#481E">4.8.1.E</a>} and a value or a scene <i>V</i> which may hold "inside" some specified locale <i>L</i> {whose <b>'DECSETY LABSETY'</b> envelops <b>'PROP'</b>} . This relationship is made to hold when <b>'PROP'</b> is "made to access" <i>V</i>  inside <i>L</i> {<a href="report_2.html#352s4">3.5.2.Step  4</a>, <a href="report_2.html#482a">4.8.2.a</a>}  and it then holds also between any <b>'PROP1'</b> equivalent to {<a href="report_1.html#2112a">2.1.1.2.a</a>} <b>'PROP'</b> and <i>V</i> inside <i>L</i>.

<p>
<a name=212d></a>d) The permanent relationships between values are: "to be of the same mode as" {<a href="report_1.html#2112c">2.1.1.2.c</a>}, "to be smaller than", "to be widenable to", "to be lengthenable to" {<a href="report_1.html#2131e">2.1.3.1.e</a>} and "to be equivalent to" {<a href="report_1.html#2131g">2.1.3.1.g</a>}. If one of these relationships is defined at all for a given pair of values, then it either holds or does not hold permanently. These relationships are all transitive.

<p>
<a name=212e></a>e) "To refer to" is a relationship between a "name" {<a href="report_1.html#2132a">2.1.3.2.a</a>} <i>N</i> and some other value. This relationship is made to hold when <i>N</i>  is "made to refer to" that value and ceases to hold when <i>N</i> is made to refer to some other value.

<p>
<a name=212f></a>f) There are three transitive relationships between scopes, viz., a scope <i>A</i> {<a href="report_1.html#2113">2.1.1.3</a>} may be either "newer than", or "the same as" or "older than" a scope <i>B</i>. If <i>A</i> is newer than <i>B</i>, then <i>B</i> is older than <i>A</i> and vice-versa. If <i>A</i> is the same as <i>B</i>, then <i>A</i> is neither newer nor older than <i>B</i> {but the converse is not necessarily true, since the relationship is not defined at all for some pairs of scopes}.

<p>
<a name=212g></a>g) "To be a subname of" is a relationship between a name and a "stowed name" {<a href="report_1.html#2132b">2.1.3.2.b</a>}. This relationship is made to hold when that stowed name is "endowed with subnames" {<a href="report_1.html#2133e">2.1.3.3.e</a>, <a href="report_1.html#2134g">2.1.3.4.g</a>} or when it is "generated" {<a href="report_1.html#2134j">2.1.3.4.j, l</a>}, and it continues to hold until that stowed name is endowed with a different set of subnames.

<p>
<a name=2131a></a>a) A plain value is either an "arithmetic value", i.e., an "integer" or a "real number", or is a  "truth value" {f}, a "character" {g} or a "void value" {h}.

<p>
<a name=2131b></a>b) An arithmetic value has a "size", i.e., an integer characterizing the degree of discrimination with which it is kept in the computer.

<p>
<a name=2131c></a>c) The mode of an integer or of a real number of size <i>n</i> is, respectively, some <b>'SIZETY integral'</b> or <b>'SIZETY real'</b>  where, if <i>n</i> is positive (zero, negative), that <b>'SIZETY'</b> is <i>n</i> times <b>'long'</b> (is empty, is <i>-n</i> times <b>'short'</b>).

<p>
<a name=2131d></a>d) The number of integers or of real numbers of a given size that can be distinguished increases (decreases) with that size until a certain size is reached, viz., the "number of extra lengths" (minus the "number of extra shorths") of integers or of real numbers, respectively, {<a href="report_5.html#A21a">10.2.1.a, b, d, e</a>} after which it is constant.

<p>
<a name=2131e></a>e) For the purpose of explaining the meaning of the widening coercion and of the <b>operators</b> declared in the <b>standard-prelude</b>, the following properties of arithmetic values are assumed:
<ul>
<li>for each pair of integers or of real numbers of the same size, the relationship "to be smaller than" is defined with its usual mathematical meaning {<a href="report_5.html#A233a">10.2.3.3.a</a>, <a href="report_5.html#A234a">10.2.3.4.a</a>};
<li>for each pair of integers of the same size, a third distinguishable integer of that size may exist, the first integer "minus" the other {<a href="report_5.html#A233g">10.2.3.3.g</a>};
<br>
<div align=right> {We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out<br>

</div>
<br>
<li>for each pair of real numbers of the same size, three distinguishable real numbers of that size may exist, the first real number "minus" ("times",    "divided by") the other one {<a href="report_5.html#A234g">10.2.3.4.g,    l, m</a>};
<li>in the foregoing, the terms "minus", "times" and "divided by" have their usual mathematical meaning but, in the case of real numbers, their results are obtained "in the sense of numerical analysis", i.e., by performing those operations on numbers which may deviate slightly from the given ones {; this deviation is left undefined in this Report};
<br>
<div align=right> {The result we proceed to divide, as you see,<br>

<br>
<li>each integer of a given size is "widenable to" a real number close to it and of that same size {<a href="report_3.html#65">6.5</a>};
<li>each integer (real number) of a given size can be "lengthened to" an integer (real number) close to it whose size is greater by one {<a href="report_5.html#A233q">10.2.3.3.q</a>, <a href="report_5.html#A234n">10.2.3.4.n</a>}.

<a name=2131g></a>g) Each "character" is "equivalent" to a nonnegative integer of size zero, its "integral equivalent" {<a href="report_5.html#A21n">10.2.1.n</a>}; this relationship is defined only to the extent that different characters have different integral equivalents, and that there exists a "largest integral equivalent" {<a href="report_5.html#A21p">10.2.1.p</a>}. The mode of a character is <b>'character'</b>.

<p>

<p>
{The elaboration of a construct yields a void value when no more useful result is needed. Since the syntax does not provide for <b>void-variables</b>,  <b>void-identity-declarations</b> or <b>void-parameters</b>, the programmer cannot make use of void values, except those arising from uniting {<a href="report_3.html#64">6.4</a>}.}

</div>

<p>
<a name=2132a></a>a) A "name" is a value which can be "made to refer to" {d,  <a href="report_2.html#5232a">5.2.3.2.a</a>, <a href="report_2.html#5212b">5.2.1.2.b</a>} some other value, or which can be "nil" {and then refers to no value};  moreover, for each mode beginning with <b>'reference to'</b>, there is exactly one nil name of that mode.

<p>
A name may be "newly created" {by the elaboration of a <b>generator</b> {<a href="report_2.html#5232">5.2.3.2</a>} or a <b>rowed-to-FORM</b> {<a href="report_3.html#662">6.6.2</a>}, when a stowed name is endowed with subnames {<a href="report_1.html#2133e">2.1.3.3.e</a>, <a href="report_1.html#2134g">2.1.3.4.g</a>} and, possibly, when a name is "generated" {<a href="report_1.html#2134j">2.1.3.4.j, l</a>} }. The name so created is different from all names already in existence.

<p>
{A name may be thought of as the address of the storage cell or cells, in the computer, used to contain the value referred to. The creation of a name implies the reservation of storage space to hold that value.}

<p>
<a name=2132b></a>b) The mode of a name <i>N</i> is some <b>'reference to MODE'</b> and any value which is referred to by <i>N</i> must be "acceptable to"  {<a href="report_1.html#2136d">2.1.3.6.d</a>} that <b>'MODE'</b>.

<p>
<a name=2133e></a>e) When a name <i>N</i> which refers to a structured value <i>V</i> is "endowed with subnames" {e, <a href="report_1.html#2134g">2.1.3.4.g</a>, <a href="report_2.html#442b">4.4.2.b</a>,  <a href="report_2.html#5232a">5.2.3.2.a</a>}, then,

For each <b>'TAG'</b> selecting a field <i>F</i> in <i>V</i>,

<h3>
<a name=2134></a>2.1.3.4. Multiple values
</h3>

<p>
<a name=2134a></a>a) A  "multiple value" {of <i>n</i> dimensions} is composed of a "descriptor" and a sequence of other values, its "elements", each of which may be "selected" by a specific <i>n</i>-tuple of integers, its "index".

<p>
<a name=2134b></a>b) The "descriptor" is of the form
<br>
 ( (l<sub>1</sub>, u<sub>1</sub>), (l<sub>2</sub>, u<sub>2</sub>), ...,  (l<sub>n</sub>, u<sub>n</sub>))<br>
where each (l<sub>i</sub>, u<sub>i</sub>), i =  1, ...,n, is a "bound pair" of integers in which l<sub>i</sub> is the <i>i</i>-th "lower bound" and u<sub>i</sub> is the <i>i</i>-th "upper bound".

<p>
<a name=2134c></a>c) If for any i, i = 1, ..., n, u<sub>i</sub> &lt;  l<sub>i</sub>, then the descriptor is said to be "flat" and there is one element, termed a "ghost element" {, and not selected by any index; see also {<a href="report_2.html#5212b">5.2.1.2.b</a>} } ; otherwise, the number of elements is (u<sub>1</sub> - l<sub>1</sub> + 1) &times; (u<sub>2</sub> - l<sub>2</sub> + 1) &times; ... &times; (u<sub>n</sub> - l<sub>n</sub> + 1)  and each is selected by a specific index r<sub>1</sub>, ..., r<sub>n</sub>  where l<sub>i</sub> &le; r<sub>i</sub> &le; u<sub>i</sub>, i = 1, ..., n.

<p>
<a name=2134d></a>d) The mode of a multiple value <i>V</i> is some <b>'ROWS of MODE'</b>, where that <b>'ROWS'</b> is composed of as many times <b>'row'</b>  as there are bound pairs in the descriptor of <i>V</i> and where each element of <i>V</i> is acceptable to {<a href="report_1.html#2136d">2.1.3.6.d</a>} that <b>'MODE'</b>.

<p>
{For example, given <tt>[ ] UNION (INT, REAL) ruir = (1, 2.0)</tt>, the mode of the yield of <tt>ruir</tt> is <b>'row of union of integral real mode'</b>, the mode of its first element is <b>'integral'</b> and that of its second element is <b>'real'</b>.}

<p>
<a name=2134e></a>e) The scope of a multiple value is the newest of the scopes of its elements, if its descriptor is not flat, and, otherwise, is the scope of the primal environ {<a href="report_1.html#222a">2.2.2.a</a>}.

<p>
<a name=2134f></a>f) A multiple value, of mode <b>'ROWS of MODE'</b>, may be referred to either by a "flexible" name of mode <b>'reference to flexible ROWS of MODE1'</b>, or by a "fixed" name of mode <b>'reference to ROWS of MODE1'</b>  where {in either case} <b>'MODE1'</b> "deflexes" {<a href="report_1.html#2136b">2.1.3.6.b</a>} to <b>'MODE'</b>.

<p>
{The difference implies a possible difference in the method whereby the value is stored in the computer. The flexible case must allow a multiple value with different bounds to be assigned {<a href="report_2.html#5212b">5.2.1.2.b</a>} to that name, whereas the fixed case can rely on the fact that those bounds will remain fixed during the lifetime of that name. Note that the "flexibility"  is a property of the name; the underlying multiple value is the same value in both cases.}

<p>
If the mode of a name <i>N</i> {referring to a multiple value} is some <b>'reference to FLEXETY ROWS of MODE'</b>, then the mode of each subname of <i>N</i> is <b>'reference to MODE'</b>.

<p>
<a name=2134g></a>g) When a name <i>N</i> which refers to a multiple value <i>V</i> is "endowed with subnames" {g, <a href="report_1.html#2133e">2.1.3.3.e</a>, <a href="report_2.html#442b">4.4.2.b</a>,  <a href="report_2.html#5212b">5.2.1.2.b</a>, <a href="report_2.html#5232a">5.2.3.2.a</a>}, then,
<br>
For each index selecting an element <i>E</i> of <i>V</i>,
<ul>
<li> a new subname <i>M</i> is created of the same scope as <i>N</i>;
<li> <i>M</i> is made to refer to <i>E</i>;
<li> <i>M</i> is said to be the name "selected" by that index in <i>N</i>;
<li>if <i>M</i> is a stowed name {<a href="report_1.html#2132b">2.1.3.2.b</a>}, then it is itself endowed with subnames
{g, <a href="report_1.html#2133e">2.1.3.3.e</a>}.
</ul>

<p>
{In addition to the selection of an element {a} or a name {g} by means of an index, it is also possible to select a value, or to generate a new name referring to such a value, by means of a trim {h, i, j} or a <b>'TAG'</b> {k, l}. Both indexes and trims are used in the elaboration of <b>slices</b> {<a href="report_2.html#5322">5.3.2.2</a>}.}

<p>
<a name=2134h></a>h) A "trim" is an <i>n</i>-tuple, each element of which is either an integer {corresponding to a <b>subscript</b>} or a triplet (l, u, d)  {corresponding to a <b>trimmer</b> or a <b>revised-lower-bound-option</b>}, such that at least one of those elements is a triplet {if all the elements are integers, then the <i>n</i>-tuple is an index {a}}. Each element of such a triplet is either an integer or is "<i>absent</i>".

<p>
{A trim (or an index) is yielded by the elaboration of an <b>indexer</b> {<a href="report_2.html#5322b">5.3.2.2.b</a>}.}

<p>
<a name=2134i></a>i) The multiple value <i>W</i> {of <i>m</i> dimensions}  "selected" by a trim <i>T</i> in a multiple value <i>V</i> {of <i>n</i>  dimensions, 1 &le; m &le; n} is determined as follows:
<ul>
<li> Let <i>T</i> be composed of integers and triplets T<sub>i</sub>, i = 1, ... n, of which <i>m</i> are actually triplets; let the <i>j</i>-th triplet be (l<sub>j</sub>, u<sub>j</sub>, d<sub>j</sub>), j = 1, ... m;
<li> <i>W</i> is composed of
<ol type=i>
<li>a descriptor ( (l<sub>1</sub> - d<sub>1</sub>, u<sub>1</sub> - d<sub>1</sub>), (l<sub>2</sub> - d<sub>2</sub>, u<sub>2</sub> - d<sub>2</sub>), ..., (l<sub>m</sub> - d<sub>m</sub>, u<sub>m</sub> - d<sub>m</sub>);
<li> elements of <i>V</i>, where the element, if any, selected in <i>W</i> by an index (w<sub>1</sub>, ..., w<sub>m</sub>) {l<sub>j</sub> - d<sub>j</sub>   &le; w<sub>j</sub> &le; u<sub>j</sub> - d<sub>j</sub>} is that selected in <i>V</i> by the index (v<sub>1</sub>, ..., v<sub>n</sub>) determined as follows:
<br>
For i = 1, ..., n,
<ul>
<a name=2134cA></a>Case A: <i>T<sub>i</sub></i> is an integer:
<ul>
<li> v<sub>i</sub> = T<sub>i</sub>;
</ul>
<a name=2134cB></a> Case B: T<sub>i</sub> is the <i>j</i>-th triplet (l<sub>j</sub>, u<sub>j</sub>, d<sub>j</sub>) of <i>T</i>:
<ul>
<li> v<sub>i</sub> = w<sub>j</sub> + d<sub>j</sub>.
</ul>
</ol>
</ul>

<p>
<a name=2134j></a>j) The name <i>M</i> "generated" by a trim <i>T</i> from a name <i>N</i> which refers to a multiple value <i>V</i> is a {fixed} name, of the same scope as <i>N</i>, {not necessarily newly created} which refers to the multiple value <i>W</i> selected {i} by <i>T</i> in <i>V</i>. Each subname of <i>M</i>, as selected by an index I<sub>W</sub>, is one of the {already existing} subnames of <i>N</i>, as selected by an index I<sub>V</sub>, where each I<sub>V</sub> is determined from <i>T</i> and the corresponding I<sub>W</sub> using the method given in the previous sub-section.

<p>
<a name=2134k></a>k) The multiple value <i>W</i> "selected" by a <b>'TAG'</b>  in a multiple value <i>V</i> {each of whose elements is a structured value} is composed of <OL type=1>   <li>the descriptor of <i>V</i>, and <li>the fields selected by <b>'TAG'</b> in the elements of <i>V</i>, where the element, if any, selected in <i>W</i> by an index <i>I</i> is the field selected by <b>'TAG'</b> in the element of <i>V</i> selected by <i>I</i>.  </li></ol>

<p>
<a name=2134l></a>l) The name <i>M</i> "generated" by a <b>'TAG'</b> from a name <i>N</i> which refers to a multiple value <i>V</i> {each of whose elements is a structured value} is a {fixed} name, of the same scope as <i>N</i>, {not necessarily newly created} which refers to the multiple value selected {k} by <b>'TAG'</b> in <i>V</i>. Each subname of <i>M</i> selected by an index <i>I</i>  is the {already existing} name selected {<a href="report_1.html#2133e">2.1.3.3.e</a>} by <b>'TAG'</b> in the subname of <i>N</i> selected {g} by <i>I</i>.

It is possible to discover which of these situations obtains, at a given moment, by means of a <b>conformity-clause</b> {<a href="report_2.html#341q">3.4.1.q</a>}.}

<p>
The mode <b>'MOID'</b> is "united from" the mode <b>'MOOD'</b> if <b>'MOID'</b> is some <b>'union of MOODSETY1 MOOD MOODSETY2 mode'</b>.

<p>
<a name=2136b></a>b) {There are no values whose mode begins with <b>'flexible'</b>. There exist flexible names whose modes begin with <b>'reference to flexible'</b>, e.g., <tt>a1</tt> in <tt>FLEX [1: n] REAL a1;</tt> . Here <tt>a1</tt>, whose mode is <b>'reference to flexible row of real'</b>, refers to a multiple value whose mode is <b>'row of real'</b> (see also <a href="report_1.html#2134f">2.1.3.4.f</a>  ). In general, there exist values only for those modes obtainable by  "deflexing".}

<p>
The mode <b>'MOID1'</b> "deflexes" to the mode <b>'MOID2'</b> if the predicate <b>'where MOID1 deflexes to MOID2'</b> holds {<a href="report_2.html#471a">4.7.1.a, b, c</a>}.
<br>
{The deflexing process obtains <b>'MOID2'</b> by removing all <b>'flexible'</b>s contained at positions in <b>'MOID1'</b> where they are not also contained in any <b>'REF to MOID3'</b>. Thus
<br>
<b>'structured with flexible row of character field letter a mode'</b>,<br>
which is not the mode of any value, deflexes to
<br>
<b>'structured with row of character field letter a mode'</b><br>
which is therefore the mode of a value referable to by a flexible name of mode
<br>
<b>'reference to structured with flexible row of character field letter a mode'</b>.<br>
This mode is already the mode of a name and therefore it cannot be deflexed any further.}

<p>
<a name=2136c></a>c) {There are no names whose mode begins with <b>'transient reference to'</b>.
<br>
The yield of a <b>transient-reference-to-MODE-FORM</b> is a "transient name"  of mode <b>'reference to MODE'</b>, but, there being no <b>transient-reference-to-MODE-declarators</b> in the language {<a href="report_2.html#461">4.6.1</a>}, the syntax ensures that transient names can never be assigned, ascribed or yielded by the calling of a routine.
<br>
E.g., <tt>xx := a1 [i]</tt> is not an <b>assignation</b> because <tt>xx</tt>  is not a <b>reference-to-transient-reference-to-real-identifier</b>. Transient names originate from the slicing, multiple selection or rowing of a flexible name.}

<p>
<a name=2136d></a>d) A value of mode <i>M1</i> is "acceptable to" a mode <i>M2</i> if
<OL type=i>
<li> <i>M1</i> is the same as <i>M2</i>, or
<li> <i>M2</i> is united {a} from <i>M1</i> {thus the mode specified by <tt>UNION (REAL, INT)</tt> accepts values whose mode is that specified by either <tt>REAL</tt> or <tt>INT</tt>}, or
<li> <i>M2</i> deflexes {b} to <i>M1</i> {thus the mode <b>'flexible row of real'</b> (a mode of which there are no values) accepts values such as the yield of the <b>actual-declarer</b> <tt>FLEX [1 : n] REAL</tt> which is a value of mode <b>'row of real'</b>}, or
<li> <i>M1</i> is some <b>'reference to MODE'</b> and <i>M2</i> is <b>'transient reference to MODE'</b> {thus the mode <b>'transient reference to real'</b> accepts values (such as the yield of <tt>a1 [i]</tt>) whose mode is <b>'reference to real'</b>} .

<a name=214></a>2.1.4. Actions
</h3>

<DIV align=right> {Suit the action to the word,<br>

</div>


<h3>
<a name=2141></a>2.1.4.1. Elaboration
</h3>

<p>
<a name=2141a></a>a) The  "elaboration" of certain scenes {those whose constructs are designated by certain paranotions} is specified in the sections of this Report headed  "Semantics", which describe the sequence of "actions" which are to be carried out during the elaboration of each such scene.
<br>
{Examples of actions which may be specified are:
<ul>
<li> the causing to hold of relationships,
<li> the creation of new names, and
<li> the elaboration of other scenes.}
</ul>
The "meaning" of a scene is the effect of the actions carried out during its elaboration. Any of these actions or any combination thereof may be replaced by any action or combination which causes the same effect.

<p>
<a name=2141b></a>b) The elaboration of a scene <i>S</i> may "yield" a value. If the construct of <i>S</i> is a <b>MOID-NOTION</b>, then that value is, unless otherwise specified, {of such a mode that it is} acceptable to {<a href="report_1.html#2136d">2.1.3.6.d</a>} <b>'MOID'</b>.
<br>
{This rule makes it possible, in the semantics, to discuss yields without explicitly prescribing their modes.}

<p>
<a name=2141c></a>c) If the elaboration of some construct <i>A</i> in some environ <i>E</i> is not otherwise specified in the semantics of this Report, and if <i>B</i> is the only direct descendent of <i>A</i> which needs elaboration {see below}, then the elaboration of <i>A</i> in <i>E</i> consists of the elaboration of <i>B</i> in <i>E</i> and the yield, if any, of <i>A</i> is the yield, if any, of <i>B</i> {; this automatic elaboration is termed the  "pre-elaboration" of <i>A</i> in <i>E</i>} .
<br>
A construct needs no elaboration if it is invisible {<a href="report_1.html#1132h">1.1.3.2.h</a>}, if it is a <b>symbol</b> {<a href="report_4.html#911h">9.1.1.h</a>}, or if its elaboration is not otherwise specified in the semantics of this Report and none of its direct descendents needs elaboration.
<br>
{Thus the elaboration of the <b>reference-to-real-closed-clause</b> {<a href="report_2.html#311a">3.1.1.a</a>} <tt> (x := 3.14)</tt> is (and yields the same value as) the elaboration of its constituent <b>reference-to-real-serial-clause</b> {<a href="report_2.html#321a">3.2.1.a</a>} <tt>x := 3.14</tt>.}

<h3>
<a name=2142></a>2.1.4.2. Serial and collateral actions
</h3>

<p>
<a name=2142a></a>a) An action may be "inseparable", "serial" or "collateral". A serial or collateral action consists of one or more other actions, termed its  "direct actions". An inseparable action does not consist of other actions {;  what actions are inseparable is left undefined by this Report}.

<p>
<a name=2142b></a>b) A "descendent action" of another action <i>B</i> is a direct action either of <i>B</i>, or of a descendent action of <i>B</i>.

<p>
<a name=2142c></a>c) An action <i>A</i> is the "direct parent" of an action <i>B</i> if <i>B</i> is a direct action {a} of <i>A</i>.

<p>
<a name=2142d></a>d) The direct actions of a serial action <i>S</i> take place one after the other; i.e., the completion {<a href="report_1.html#2143c">2.1.4.3.c, d</a>} of a direct action of <i>S</i> is followed by the initiation {<a href="report_1.html#2143b">2.1.4.3.b, c</a>} of the next direct action, if any, of <i>S</i>. {The elaboration of a scene, being in general composed of a sequence of actions, is a serial action.}

<p>
<a name=2142e></a>e) The direct actions of a collateral action are merged in time; i.e., one of its descendent inseparable actions which, at that moment, is  "active" {<a href="report_1.html#2143a">2.1.4.3.a</a>} is chosen and carried out, upon the completion {<a href="report_1.html#2143c">2.1.4.3.c</a>} of which another such action is chosen, and so on {until all are completed}.

<p>
If two actions {collateral with each other} have been said to be  "incompatible with" {<a href="report_5.html#A24">10.2.4</a>}  each other, then {they shall not be merged; i.e.,} no descendent inseparable action of the one shall (then the one {if it is already inseparable} shall not)  be chosen if, at that moment, the other is active and one or more, but not all, of its descendent inseparable actions have already been completed; otherwise, the method of choice is left undefined in this Report.

<p>
<a name=2142f></a>f) If one or more scenes are to be "elaborated collaterally", then this elaboration is the collateral action consisting of the {merged} elaboration of those scenes.

<h3>
<a name=2143></a>2.1.4.3. Initiation, completion and termination
</h3>

<p>
<a name=2143a></a>a) An action is either "active" or "inactive".

<p>
An action becomes active when it is "initiated" {b, c} or "resumed" {g} and it becomes inactive when it is "completed" {c, d}, "terminated" {e}, "halted" {f} or  "interrupted" {h}.

<p>
<a name=2143b></a>b) When a serial action is "initiated", then the first of its direct actions is initiated. When a collateral action is "initiated", then all of its direct actions are initiated.

<p>
<a name=2143c></a>c) When an inseparable action is "initiated", it may then be carried out {see <a href="report_1.html#2142e">2.1.4.2.e</a>}, whereupon it is "completed".

<p>
<a name=2143d></a>d) A serial action is "completed" when its last direct action has been completed. A collateral action is "completed" when all of its direct actions have been completed.

<p>
<a name=2143e></a>e) When an action <i>A</i> {whether serial or collateral}  is "terminated", then all of its direct actions {and hence all of its descendent actions} are terminated {whereupon another action may be initiated in its place}  . {Termination of an action is brought about by the elaboration of a <b>jump</b>  {<a href="report_2.html#5442">5.4.4.2</a>}.}

<p>
<a name=2143f></a>f) When an action is "halted", then all of its active direct actions {and hence all of its active descendent actions} are halted. {An action may be halted during a "calling" of the routine yielded by the <b>operator</b> <tt>DOWN</tt> {<a href="report_5.html#A24d">10.2.4.d</a>}, whereupon it may subsequently be resumed during a calling of the routine yielded by the <b>operator</b> <tt>UP</tt> {<a href="report_5.html#A24e">10.2.4.e</a>}.}

<p>
If, at any time, some action is halted and it is not descended from a  "process" of a "parallel action" {<a href="report_5.html#A24">10.2.4</a>}  of whose other process (es) there still exist descendent active inseparable actions, then the further elaboration is undefined. {Thus it is not defined that the elaboration of the <b>collateral-clause</b> in
<pre>
BEGIN SEMA sergei = LEVEL 0;
   (PAR BEGIN (DOWN sergei; print (pokrovsky)), SKIP END,
      (read (pokrovsky); UP sergei))
END
</pre>
will ever be completed.}

<p>
<a name=2143g></a>g) When an action <i>A</i> is "resumed", then those of its direct actions which had been halted consequent upon the halting of <i>A</i> are resumed.

<p>
<a name=2143h></a>h) An action may be "interrupted" by an event {e.g.,  "overflow"} not specified by the semantics of this Report but caused by the computer if its limitations {<a href="report_1.html#222b">2.2.2.b</a>} do not permit satisfactory elaboration. When an action is interrupted, then all of its direct actions, and possibly its direct parent also, are interrupted.  {Whether, after an interruption, that action is resumed, some other action is initiated or the elaboration of the <b>program</b> ends, is left undefined by this Report.}

<p>
{The effect of the definitions given above is as follows:
<br
During the elaboration of a <b>program</b> {<a href="report_1.html#222a">2.2.2.a</a>} the elaboration of its <b>closed-clause</b> in the empty primal environ is active. At any given moment, the elaboration of one scene may have called for the elaboration of some other scene or of several other scenes collaterally. If and when the elaboration of that other scene or scenes has been completed, the next step of the elaboration of the original scene is taken, and so on until it, in turn, is completed.
<br>
It will be seen that all this is analogous to the calling of one subroutine by another; upon the completion of the execution of the called subroutine, the execution of the calling subroutine is continued; the semantic rules given in this Report for the elaboration of the various paranotions correspond to the texts of the subroutines; the semantic rules may even, in suitable circumstances, invoke themselves recursively (but with a different construct or in a different environ on each occasion).
<br>
Thus there exists, at each moment, a tree of active actions descended {<a href="report_1.html#2142b">2.1.4.2.b</a>} from the elaboration of the <b>program</b>.}

<h3>
<a name=215></a>2.1.5. Abbreviations
</h3>

<p>
{In order to avoid some long and turgid phrases which would otherwise have been necessary in the Semantics, certain abbreviations are used freely throughout the text of this Report.}

<p>
<a name=215a></a>a) The phrase "the <i>A</i> of <i>B</i>", where <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are paranotions, stands for "the <i>A</i> which is a direct descendent {<a href="report_1.html#1132f">1.1.3.2.f</a>} of <i>B</i>".
<br>
{This permits the abbreviation of "direct descendent of" to "of" or "its", e.g., in the <b>assignation</b> {<a href="report_2.html#5211a">5.2.1.1.a</a>} <tt>i := 1</tt>, <tt>i</tt> is "its" <b>destination</b> (or <tt>i</tt> is the, or a, <b>destination</b> "of" the <b>assignation</b> <tt>i := 1</tt>), whereas <tt>i</tt> is not a <b>destination</b> of the <b>serial-clause</b> <tt>i := 1; j  := 2</tt> (although it is a constituent <b>destination</b> {<a href="report_1.html#1142d">1.1.4.2.d</a>} of it).}

<p>
<a name=215b></a>b) The phrase "<i>C</i> in <i>E</i>", where <i>C</i> is a construct and <i>E</i> is an environ, stands for "the scene composed {<a href="report_1.html#2111d">2.1.1.1.d</a>} of <i>C</i> and <i>E</i>". It is sometimes even further shortened to just  "<i>C</i>" when it is clear which environ is meant.
<br>
{Since the process of elaboration {<a href="report_1.html#2141a">2.1.4.1.a</a>} may be applied only to scenes, this abbreviation appears most frequently in forms such as "A <b>loop-clause</b> <i>C</i>, in an environ <i>E1</i>, is elaborated ... " {<a href="report_2.html#352">3.5.2</a>}  and "An <b>assignation</b> <i>A</i> is elaborated ... " (<a href="report_2.html#5212a">5.2.1.2.a</a>, where it is the elaboration of <i>A</i> in any appropriate environ that is being discussed).}

<p>
<a name=215c></a>c) The phrase "the yield of <i>S</i>", where <i>S</i> is a scene whose elaboration is not explicitly prescribed, stands for "the yield obtained by initiating the elaboration of <i>S</i> and awaiting its completion".
<br>
{Thus the sentence {<a href="report_2.html#322c">3.2.2.c</a>} :
<ul>
"<i>W</i> is the yield of that <b>unit</b>;"
</ul>
 (which also makes use of the abbreviation defined in b above) is to be interpreted as meaning:
<ul>
"<i>W</i> is the yield obtained upon the completion of the elaboration,    hereby initiated, of the scene composed of that <b>unit</b> and the environ under discussion;" .
</ul>
}

<p>
<a name=215d></a>d) The phrase "the yields of S<sub>1</sub>, ..., S<sub>n</sub> ", where S<sub>1</sub>, ..., S<sub>n</sub> are scenes whose elaboration is not explicitly prescribed, stands for "the yields obtained by initiating the collateral elaboration {<a href="report_1.html#2142f">2.1.4.2.f</a>} of S<sub>1</sub>, ..., S<sub>n</sub> and awaiting its completion {which implies the completion of the elaboration on them all} ".
<br>
If some or all of S<sub>1</sub>, ..., S<sub>n</sub> are described as being, in some environ, certain constituents of some construct, then their yields are to be considered as being taken in the textual order {<a href="report_1.html#1132i">1.1.3.2.i</a>} of those constituents within that construct.
<br>
{Thus the sentence {<a href="report_2.html#332b">3.3.2.b</a>} :
<ul>
"let V<sub>1</sub>, ..., V<sub>m</sub> be the {collateral} yields of the constituent <b>units</b> of <i>C</i>;"
</ul>
is to be interpreted as meaning:
<ul>
"let V<sub>1</sub>, ..., V<sub>m</sub> be the respective yields obtained upon the completion of the collateral elaboration, hereby initiated, of the scenes composed of the constituent <b>units</b> of <i>C</i>, considered in their textual order, together with the environ in which <i>C</i> was being elaborated;" .
</ul>
}

<p>
<a name=215e></a>e) The phrase "if <i>A</i> is <i>B</i>", where <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are hypernotions, stands for "if <i>A</i> is equivalent {<a href="report_1.html#2112a">2.1.1.2.a</a>} to <i>B</i>".
<br>
{Thus, in "Case C: <b>'CHOICE'</b> is some <b>'choice using UNITED'</b>" {<a href="report_2.html#342b">3.4.2.b</a>}, it matters not whether <b>'CHOICE'</b> happens to begin with <b>'choice using union of'</b> or with some <b>'choice using MU definition of union of'</b>.}

<p>
<a name=215f></a>f) The phrase "the mode is <i>A</i>", where <i>A</i> is a hypernotion, stands for "the mode {is a class of <b>'MOID'</b>s which} includes <i>A</i>".
<br>
{This permits such shortened forms as "the mode is some <b>'structured with FIELDS mode'</b>", "the mode begins with <b>'union of'</b>", and "the mode envelops a <b>'FIELD'</b>"; in general, a mode may be specified by quoting just one of the <b>'MOID'</b>s included in it.}

<p>
<a name=215g></a>g) The phrase "the value selected (generated) by the <b>field-selector</b> <i>F</i>" stands for "if <i>F</i> is a <b>field-selector-with-TAG</b> {<a href="report_2.html#481f">4.8.1.f</a>}, then the value selected {<a href="report_1.html#2133a">2.1.3.3.a, e</a>, <a href="report_1.html#2134k">2.1.3.4.k</a>}  (generated {<a href="report_1.html#2134l">2.1.3.4.l</a>} ) by that <b>'TAG'</b>".

and a good many that haven't been invented just yet."<br>
Through the Looking-glass, Lewis Carroll.}
</div>

<p>
<a name=222a></a>a) The elaboration of a <b>program</b> is the elaboration of its <b>strong-void-new-closed-clause</b> in an empty environ {<a href="report_1.html#2111c">2.1.1.1.c</a>} termed the "primal environ".
<br>
{Although the purpose of this Report is to define the meaning of a <b>particular-program</b> (<a href="report_5.html#A11g">10.1.1.g</a>), that meaning is established only by first defining the meaning of a <b>program</b> in which that <b>particular-program</b> is embedded (<a href="report_5.html#A12">10.1.2</a>).}

<p>
{In this Report, the syntax says which sequences of symbols are terminal productions of <b>'program'</b>, and the semantics which actions are performed by the computer when elaborating a program. Both syntax and semantics are recursive. Though certain sequences of symbols may be terminal productions of <b>'program'</b> in more than one way (see also <a href="report_1.html#1132f">1.1.3.2.f</a>  ), this syntactic ambiguity does not lead to a semantic ambiguity.}

<p>
<a name=222b></a>b) In ALGOL 68, a specific syntax for constructs is provided which, together with its recursive definition, makes it possible to describe and to distinguish between arbitrarily large production trees, to distinguish between arbitrarily many different values of a given mode (except certain modes like <b>'boolean'</b> and <b>'void'</b>) and to distinguish between arbitrarily many modes, which allows arbitrarily many objects to exist within the computer and which allows the elaboration of a <b>program</b> to involve an arbitrarily large, not necessarily finite, number of actions. This is not meant to imply that the notation of the objects in the computer is that used in this Report nor that it has the same possibilities. It is not assumed that these two notations are the same nor even that a one-to-one correspondence exists between them; in fact, the set of different notations of objects of a given category may be finite. It is not assumed that the computer can handle arbitrary amounts of presented information. It is not assumed that the speed of the computer is sufficient to elaborate a given <b>program</b> within a prescribed lapse of time, nor that the number of objects and relationships that can be established is sufficient to elaborate it at all.

<p>
<a name=222c></a>c) A model of the hypothetical computer, using a physical machine, is said to be an "implementation" of ALGOL 68 if it does not restrict the use of the language in other respects than those mentioned above. Furthermore, if a language <i>A</i> is defined whose <b>particular-programs</b>  are also <b>particular-programs</b> of a language <i>B</i>, and if each such <b>particular-program</b> for which a meaning is defined in <i>A</i> has the same defined meaning in <i>B</i>, then <i>A</i> is said to be a "sublanguage" of <i>B</i>, and <i>B</i> a "superlanguage" of <i>A</i>.
<br>
{Thus a sublanguage of ALGOL 68 might be defined by omitting some part of the syntax, by omitting some part of the <b>standard-prelude</b>, and/or by leaving undefined something which is defined in this Report, so as to enable more efficient solutions to certain classes of problem or to permit implementation on smaller machines.
<br>
Likewise, a superlanguage of ALGOL 68 might be defined by additions to the syntax, semantics or <b>standard-prelude</b>, so as to improve efficiency (by allowing the user to provide additional information) or to permit the solution of problems not readily amenable to ALGOL 68.}
<br>
A model is said to be an implementation of a sublanguage if it does not restrict the use of the sublanguage in other respects than those mentioned above.
<br>
{See <a href="report_4.html#93c">9.3.c</a>  for the term "implementation of the reference language".}

<p>
{A sequence of <b>symbols</b> which is not a <b>particular-program</b> but can be turned into one by deleting or inserting a certain number of <b>symbols</b> and not a smaller number could be regarded as a <b>particular-program</b> with that number of syntactical errors. Any <b>particular-program</b> that can be obtained by deleting or inserting that number of symbols may be termed a "possibly intended" <b>particular-program</b>. Whether a <b>particular-program</b> or one of the possibly intended <b>particular-programs</b> has the effect its author in fact intended it to have is a matter which falls outside this Report.}

<p>
{In an implementation, the <b>particular-program</b> may be "compiled", i.e., translated into an "object program" in the code of the physical machine. Under certain circumstances, it may be advantageous to compile parts of the <b>particular-program</b> independently, e.g., parts which are common to several <b>particular-programs</b>. If such a part contains <b>applied-indicators</b>  which identify <b>defining-indicators</b> not contained in that part, then compilation into an efficient object program may be assured by preceding the part by a sequence of <b>declarations</b> containing those <b>defining-indicators</b>.}

<p>
{The definition of specific sublanguages and also the specification of actions not definable by any <b>program</b> (e.g., compilation or initiation of the elaboration) is not given in this Report. See, however, <a href="report_4.html#92">9.2</a> for the suggested use of <b>pragmats</b> to control such actions.}
