<h3>
<a name=Pref></a>Preface to HTML translation 1.2
</h3>

<p>
This is a translation {<a href="report_1.html#115">1.1.5</a>} of the Algol 68 Revised Report into HTML, for distribution with <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~jmvdveer/algol.html">Algol 68 Genie</a>, an Open Source Algol 68 interpreter. Since Algol 68 Genie became available on the Internet, it has become clear that there still are many people who are interested in an Algol 68 implementation, the majority of them being mathematicians or computer scientists. Hence it is expected that there are also people interested in having access to the formal defining document, the Algol 68 Revised Report, 
which is unfortunately out of print. It is believed that a HTML translation may well meet this need and enable people to study the formal description of Algol 68, a language that over the years has caused much debate (these debates may well be another <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> for this HTML translation).

<p>
ALGOrithmic Language Algol 68 was designed by 
<a href="http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/jeremy.gibbons/wg21/">IFIP Working Group 2.1</a> 
 (Algorithmic Languages and Calculi) as a general-purpose programming language. 
This working group has continuing responsibility for Algol 60 and Algol 68.
Algol 68 is a rather lean orthogonal general-purpose language that is a beautiful means for denoting algorithms.

<p>
In the early 1960's Working Group 2.1 started discussing the development of Algol X, a successor to Algol 60. At its 1965 meeting in St. Pierre de Chartreuse, three reports describing more or less complete languages, by Wirth, Seegm&uuml;ller, and Van Wijngaarden, were amongst the contributions.
Van Wijngaarden's paper <i>Orthogonal design and description of a formal language</i> 
 (available from <a href="http://www.fh-jena.de/~kleine/history/history.html">
Karl Kleine's collection</a>) featured a new technique for language design and definition. 
This paper formed the basis for what would develop into Algol 68. Wirth left the project to work on Algol W which influenced his later language Pascal.

<p>
Algol 68 was defined in a formal document, first published in January 1969,
and later published in <i>Acta Informatica</i> and also printed in <i>Sigplan Notices</i>.
A revised report was issued in 1976. 
Algol 68 was the first major language for which a full formal definition was made before it was implemented. 
At the time the formal defining reports on&nbsp; Algol 68 were known to rank 
among the difficult publications in computer science, and they probably still 
do.

<p>
Probably because of the formal character of the Revised Report, which requires study to comprehend, the misconception got hold that Algol 68 is a complex language, while in fact it is rather lean. Algol 68's grammar is a two-level W-grammar ('W' for Van <u>W</u>ijngaarden) that can define a potentially infinite grammar in a finite number of rules. It can rigorously define some syntactic restrictions that otherwise 
have to be formulated in natural language, despite their essentially syntactical content; for example, demanding that applied identifiers or - operators be declared, or demanding that modes result in finite objects that require finite coercion, etcetera. 
In that respect, a context-free syntax needs extra rules formulated in natural language to reject incorrect programs. This is less elegant, but defining documents for programming languages with a context-free grammar indeed look less complex than the Algol 
68 (Revised) Report - see for instance the <a href="syntax.html">context-free grammar</a> of Algol 68 Genie.

<p>
Another factor that hindered Algol 68 from spreading rapidly is that the language was designed for programmers, not for compiler writers, when the field of compiler construction was not as advanced as it is today. Implementation efforts based on formal methods generally failed; Algol 68's context-dependent grammar required some invention to parse. 

<p>
At the time of Algol 68's presentation compilers usually were made available on mainframes by computing centers, which may explain why Algol 68 was popular in locations rather than areas, for instance Amsterdam, Berlin or Cambridge. It appears that Algol 68 was relatively popular in the UK, where the ALGOL68RS and ALGOL68C compilers were developed. An important clue to understanding why Algol 68 did not become a widely used language lies in the fact that industry did not pick it up and that initiatives to commercialise Algol 68 compilers were relatively unsuccessful, for instance the FLACC compiler ran on just twenty-two installations. The market for universal programming languages evidently did not develop as hoped for during the decade in which the language was developed and implemented.

<p>
The language is nowadays still referred to in teaching material, discussions and publications. 
Because of the rigour and precision of its definition, one could argue that a student reading computer science should, at an appropriate moment, study Algol 68, irrespective of whether the language did or did not spread widely at the time it was presented.
For programmers, the world has of course moved on, but the reactions on Algol 68 Genie 
suggest that many people who have seriously programmed in Algol 68 in the past, only moved to other programming languages because the Algol 68 implementations they were using were phased out. The observations 
mentioned here are believed to be sufficient ground to preserve Algol 68, both by 
making available its defining document as well as an <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~jmvdveer/algol.html">implementation</a> as to enable those interested in the language to both study it, and use it.

This HTML translation {<a href="report_1.html#115">1.1.5</a>} by J.M. van der Veer is a completed and corrected version of the <a href="http://vestein.arb-phys.uni-dortmund.de/~wb/"> version by W.B. Kloke</a>. Code examples adopt upper-stropping for bold symbols, hence where in the original publication <b><i>begin</i></b> is used, in the translation <tt>BEGIN</tt> will be used. Lay-out may differ in places from that of the original publication. Some <b>character-glyph</b>s {<a href="report_4.html#8141">8.1.4.1c, d</a>} that are no longer readily available (for example <b>floor symbol</b> or <b>ceiling symbol</b>) have been omitted from this text.  This translation contains comments which are not part of the original text and are contained in parentheses <var>[[ ... a posteriori comments ... ]]</var>. 

<p>
I would like to thank Andy Walker and Charles Lindsey for proofreading this translation.
This translation should be an acceptable representation of the original publication, but if you have a remark, or find an error, please send a note to <a href="mailto:algol68g@xs4all.nl">algol68g@xs4all.nl</a>. Your feedback will be greatly appreciated.
