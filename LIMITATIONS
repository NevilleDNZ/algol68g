ALGOL68G - ALGOL 68 GENIE (MARK 9)
----------------------------------

* A garbage collector cannot solve all memory allocation issues. It is 
  therefore possible to get an unexpected "out of memory" diagnostic. Two
  options in such case are (1) to increase heap size or (2) to call standard
  prelude routine "sweep heap" or "preempive sweep heap" at strategic 
  positions in the program.

* The interpreter offers a method of checking the system stack (see the 
  INSTALL file). When this check is not activated, or on systems where this 
  method would not work, the following may result in a segment violation: 

  - Deep recursion.
  - Garbage collection of deeply recursive data structures.
  - Using jumps to move between incarnations of recursive procedures.

* When the stack overhead is set to a too small value, a segment violation may
  occur. Refer to the documentation on option -overhead=value.

* Algorithms for extended precision (LONG LONG INT, LONG LONG REAL and 
  LONG LONG COMPLEX) are not really suited for precisions larger than about a 
  thousand digits. State of the art in the field offers more efficient 
  algorithms than implemented here.

* Overflow- and underflow checks on REAL and COMPLEX are not implemented 
  for non IEEE-754 hardware.
