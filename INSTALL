ALGOL68G - ALGOL 68 GENIE (MARK 4)

Algol68G is free software distributed under GNU GPL. This software is 
distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty.

BUILDING ALGOL68G

If available on your system, Algol68G uses GNU plotutils (version 2.4.0 or 
compatible) for its graphics routines, and also uses the GNU scientific library 
(version 1.4 or compatible) to implement extensions of the standard prelude.  
The 'configure' script checks /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include for shared 
libraries and necessary includes. If necessary files are not detected then 
Algol68G builds without support for absent libraries - Algol68G can run without 
GNU plotutils or the GNU scientific library.


A. GENERIC INSTALLATION

For a generic installation, follow next instructions.

(A.1)  Make the distribution directory the present working directory.

(A.2)  Type 

              ./configure

       This will generate a makefile. The configure script accepts various
       options. For an overview of options, type

              ./configure -h

(A.3)  Type 

              make depend

       This will register dependencies needed to build Algol68G.

(A.4a) If you do not want to install Algol68G for all users, type 

              make all

       The executable 'a68g' will be put in the present working directory.

(A.4b) If you want to install Algol68G for all users to use, type 

              make install

       to make available the executable and a manual page.
       Targets for those files are /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/man. 
       If latter directory does not exist, /usr/share/man and then /usr/man 
       are tried.

       The installation can be undone by typing

              make uninstall

(A.4c) Note that in (A.4a,b) you can supply CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS and LDFLAGS;
       for instance type 

              make all CFLAGS="-O" 

       to optimise the code.

(A.5)  Type 

              make clean 

       to remove binaries used for building Algol68G. As to remove all files 
       used for installation, type 

              make distclean


B. CUSTOMISED INSTALLATION

For a customised installation some configuration is required, that cannot be 
reliably automated. Configuration switches in file 'source/a68g_config.h' are 
set to default values that should work on Linux and FreeBSD in a generic 
installation.

(B.1)  If you want the interpreter to check system stack size then define
       DO_SYSTEM_STACK_CHECK in file 'a68g_config.h'. This check assumes that 
       the stack grows linearly (either upwards or downwards) and that the 
       difference between (1) the address of a local variable in the current 
       stack frame and (2) the address of a local variable in a stack frame 
       at the start of execution of the Algol 68 program, is a measure of 
       system stack size.
   
(B.2)  If you have GNU plotutils on your system, you may define 
       HAVE_MODIFIABLE_X_TITLE in file 'a68g_config.h' if you have modifiable 
       titles for X windows. Since GNU plotutils routines do not allow changing 
       X window names, a trivial adaptation is required of plotutils source file
       'y_openpl.c'. This modified file comes with the Algol68G distribution 
       (in directory 'foreign') and can be used to rebuild GNU plotutils.

(B.3)  Follow instructions as for 'generic installation'.
