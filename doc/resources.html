<h3><a name="history"></a>A brief history of Algol 68</h3>

<p>
ALGOrithmic Language Algol 68 was designed by 
<a href="http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/jeremy.gibbons/wg21/">IFIP Working Group 2.1</a> 
(Algorithmic Languages and Calculi) as a general-purpose programming language. 
This working group has continuing responsibility for Algol 60 and Algol 68.
Algol 68 is a rather lean orthogonal general-purpose language that is a beautiful means for denoting algorithms.

<p>
In the early 1960's Working Group 2.1 started discussing the development of Algol X, a successor to Algol 60. At its 1965 meeting in Princeton, WG 2.1 invited written descriptions of the language based on the previous discussions. At the meeting in St. Pierre de Chartreuse, also in 1965, three reports describing more or less complete languages, by Wirth, Seegm&uuml;ller, and Van Wijngaarden, were amongst the contributions. 
Other significant contributions were papers by Hoare and Naur. 
Van Wijngaarden's paper <i>Orthogonal design and description of a formal language</i> 
(available from <a href="#documentation">Karl Kleine's collection</a>) featured a new technique for language design and definition. 
This paper formed the basis for what would develop into Algol 68. Wirth left the project to work on Algol W which influenced his later language Pascal.

<p>
Algol 68 was defined in a formal document, first published in January 1969,
and later published in <a href="#ref">Acta Informatica</a> and also printed in <a href="#ref">Sigplan Notices</a>.
A revised report was issued in 1976. 
The distribution of Algol 68 Genie Mark 12 contains a HTML translation of the <a href="report_contents.html">Revised Report</a>.
Algol 68 was the first major language for which a full formal definition was made before it was implemented.

<p>
Probably because of the formal character of the Revised Report, which requires study to comprehend, the misconception got hold that Algol 68 is a complex language, while in fact it is rather lean. Algol 68's grammar is a two-level W-grammar ('W' for Van <u>W</u>ijngaarden) that can define a potentially infinite grammar in a finite number of rules. It can rigorously define some syntactic restrictions that otherwise 
have to be formulated in natural language, despite their essentially syntactical content; for example, demanding that applied identifiers or - operators be declared, or demanding that modes result in finite objects that require finite coercion, etcetera. In that respect, a context-free syntax needs extra rules formulated in natural language to reject incorrect programs. This is less elegant, but defining documents for programming languages with a context-free grammar indeed look less complex than the Algol 
68 (Revised) Report - see for instance the <a href="syntax.html">context-free grammar</a> of Algol 68 Genie.

<p>
Another factor that hindered Algol 68 from spreading rapidly is that the language was designed for programmers, not for compiler writers, in a time when the field of compiler construction was not as advanced as it is today. Implementation efforts based on formal methods generally failed; Algol 68's context-dependent grammar required some invention to parse (consider for instance <code>x(y, z)</code> that can be either a call or a slice depending on the mode of <code>x</code>, while <code>x</code> does not need to be declared <i>before</i> being applied). Algol 68 Genie employs a multipass scheme to parse Algol 68 <a href="resources.html#ref">[Lindsey 1993]</a>.

<p>
At the time of Algol 68's presentation compilers usually were made available on mainframes by computing centers, which may explain why Algol 68 was popular in locations rather than areas, for instance Amsterdam, Berlin or Cambridge. It appears that Algol 68 was relatively popular in the UK, where the ALGOL68RS and ALGOL68C compilers were developed. An important clue to understanding why Algol 68 did not become a widely used language lies in the fact that industry did not pick it up and that initiatives to commercialise Algol 68 compilers were relatively unsuccessful, for instance the FLACC compiler sold just twenty-two copies. The market for universal programming languages evidently did not develop as hoped for during the decade in which the language was developed and implemented.

<p>
The language is nowadays still referred to in teaching material, discussions and publications. 
Because of the rigour and precision of its definition, one could argue that a student reading computer science should, at an appropriate moment, study Algol 68, irrespective of whether the language did or did not spread widely at the time it was presented.
For programmers, the world has of course moved on, but the reactions on Algol 68 Genie 
suggest that many people who have seriously programmed in Algol 68 in the past, only moved to other programming languages because the Algol 68 implementations they were using were phased out.

<h3><a name="implementations"></a>Algol 68 implementations</h3>
<h4>Current other implementations</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~chl/">Algol 68S compiler</a> by Charles Lindsey.
<li>Algol 68 to C translator (<code>a68toc</code>), a ported compiler by Sian Leitch. 
The front-end essentially is the Algol 68 RS portable
compiler originally written by the Defence Research Agency when it
was known as the RSRE (Royal Signals and Radar Establishment). Only
that part of Algol 68 needed for the ELLA compiler was implemented by
<code>a68toc</code>; therefore formats are unavailable. Algol 68 RS did not
implement the parallel-clause.
The <code>a68toc</code> distribution is available from
<a href="#nunan">Greg Nunan's site</a>.
<li>Others from 
<a href="#nunan">Greg Nunan's site</a>
or the
<a href="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Languages/Algol_68/">Algol 68 directory</a> from the Open Directory Project.
