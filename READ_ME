ALGOL68G - ALGOL 68 GENIE (MARK 8)

Algol68G is a nearly fully featured implementation of Algol 68 as defined by 
the Revised Report. It provides multi-precision arithmetic, (optionally) 
graphical support and (optionally) extended mathematical support.

Author of Algol68G is Marcel van der Veer <algol68g@xs4all.nl>.
Web pages for Algol68G are at <http://www.xs4all.nl/~jmvdveer>.

Algol68G's front-end parses an entire Algol 68 source program. If parsing is 
successful, the syntax tree (that serves as an intermediate program 
representation) is interpreted by Algol68G's back-end. The interpreter performs
many runtime checks.
